Rainbow Reptiles is a small reptile breeding facility where we breed Amazon Tree Boas for wholesale to pet stores and private sales.

As a small and specialised breeding facility we are passionate about the well-being of our snakes. Hygiene and individual care is very important to us and forms the back bone of our success. We have established a collection of high quality  Amazon Tree Boas *Corallus hortulanus* that we are proud of.

If you are interested in a pricelist please contact us for a list of available stock on 252 285 6550 or m.staats@rocketmail.com
